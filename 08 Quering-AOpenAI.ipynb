This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms to carry out psychological intervention to patients, their families and medical staff.

We show that for every fixed integer k, there is a linear-time algorithm to decide\\nthe problem LSM (large stable models problem): does a logic program P have a stable\\nmodel of size at least |P | − k. In contrast, we show that the problem SSM (small stable\\nmodels problem) to decide whether a logic program P has a stable model of size at most\\nk is much harder. We present two algorithms for this problem but their running time is\\ngiven by polynomials of order depending on k. We show that the problem SSM is fixed-\\nparameter intractable by demonstrating that it is W [2]-hard. This result implies that it is\\nunlikely, an algorithm exists to compute stable models of size at most k that would run\\nin time O(nc), where c is a constant independent of k. We also provide an upper bound\\non the fixed-parameter complexity of the problem SSM by showing that it belongs to the\\nclass W [3].\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nThe stable model semantics by Gelfond and Lifschitz [10] is one of the two most widely\\nstudied semantics for normal logic programs, the other one being the well-founded seman-\\ntics by Van Gelder, Ross and Schlipf [17]. Among 2-valued semantics, the stable model\\nsemantics is commonly regarded as the one providing the correct meaning to the negation\\noperator in logic programming. It coincides with the least model semantics on the class\\nof Horn programs, and with the well-founded semantics and the perfect model semantics\\non the class of stratified programs [1]. In addition, the stable model semantics is closely\\nrelated to the notion of a default extension by Reiter [12, 4]. Logic programming with sta-\\nble model semantics has applications in knowledge representation, planning and reasoning\\nabout action. It was also recently proposed as a computational paradigm especially well\\nsuited for solving combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems [14, 15].\\n\\nThe problem with the stable model semantics is that, even in the propositional case,\\nreasoning with logic programs under the stable model semantics is computationally hard. It\\nis well-known that deciding whether a finite propositional logic program has a stable model\\nis NP-complete [13]. Consequently, it is not at all clear that logic programming with the\\nstable model semantics can serve as a practical computational tool.\\n\\n1This is a full version of an extended abstract presented at the International Conference on Logic Pro-\\ngramming, ICLP-99 and included in the proceedings published by MIT Press.\\n\\n1\\n\\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0002001v1\\n\\n\\nThis issue can be resolved by implementing systems computing stable models and by\\nexperimentally studying the performance of these systems. Several such projects are now\\nunder way. Niemelä and Simons [16] developed a system, smodels, for computing stable\\nmodels of finite function symbol-free logic programs and reported very promising perfor-\\nmance results. For some classes of programs, smodels decides the existence of a stable\\nmodel in a matter of seconds even if an input program consists of tens of thousands of\\nclauses. Encouraging results on using smodels to solve planning problems are reported\\nin [15]. Another well-advanced system is DeReS [6], designed to compute extensions of\\narbitrary propositional default theories but being especially effective for default theories\\nencoding propositional logic programs. Finally, systems capable of reasoning with disjunc-\\ntive logic programs were described in [9] and [2].\\n\\nHowever, faster implementations will ultimately depend on better understanding of the\\nalgorithmic aspects of reasoning with logic programs under the stable model semantics. In\\nthis paper, we investigate the complexity of deciding whether a finite propositional logic\\nprogram has stable models of some restricted sizes. Specifically, we study the following two\\nproblems (|P | stands for the number of rules in a logic program P ):\\n\\nLSM (Large stable models) Given a finite propositional logic program P and an integer k,\\ndecide whether there is a stable model of P of size at least |P | − k.\\n\\nSSM (Small stable models) Given a finite propositional logic program P and an integer k,\\ndecide whether there is a stable model of P of size no more than k.\\n\\nInputs to the problems LSM and SSM are pairs (P, k), where P is a finite propositional\\nlogic program and k is a non-negative integer. Problems of this type are referred to as\\nparametrized decision problems. By fixing a parameter, a parameterized decision problem\\ngives rise to its fixed-parameter version.

First, for each atom\\nq ∈ At(P ), introduce k2 + 2k new atoms d(q, i), 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 + 2k, and define\\n\\nC0(q) = {¬c(q) ∨ d(q, i): 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 + 2k} ∪ {c(q) ∨ ¬d(q, i): 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 + 2k}.\\n\\nNext, define\\n\\nC1(q, i) = {¬c−(q, i) ∨ c(q, 1) ∨ . . . ∨ c(q, i− 1)} ∪ {¬c(q, j) ∨ c−(q, i): 1 ≤ j ≤ i− 1},\\n\\nC2(q) = {¬c(q) ∨ c(q, 1) ∨ . . . ∨ c(q, k + 1)} ∪ {¬c(q, j) ∨ c(q): 1 ≤ j ≤ k + 1},\\n\\nand\\n\\nC4(q, i) = {¬c(q, i) ∨ F3(r1, i) ∨ . . . ∨ F3(rt, i)} ∪ {¬F3(rj , i) ∨ c(q, i): 1 ≤ j ≤ m},\\n\\nwhere {r1, . . . , rt} is the set of all rules in P with q in the head.\\nFinally, define\\n\\nT (P ) = {C0(q): q ∈ At(P )} ∪ {C1(q, i): q ∈ At(P ), 2 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} ∪\\n\\n{C2(q): q ∈ At(P )} ∪ {C4(q, i): q ∈ At(P ), 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1}\\n\\nIt is easy to see that the set of clauses C1(q, i) is equivalent to the formula F1(q, i), the set\\nof clauses C2(q) is equivalent to the formula F2(q), and the set C4(q, i) of disjunctions of\\nconjunctions of literals is equivalent to the formula F4(q, i). Thus, the union of the last three\\nsets of clauses in the definition of T (P ) is logically equivalent to the theory T0(P ). It follows\\nthat U ⊆ {c(q): q ∈ At} ∪ {c(q, i): q ∈M, 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} ∪ {c−(q, i): q ∈M, 2 ≤ i ≤ k + 1}\\nis a model of T0(P ) if and only if U ∪{d(q, i): c(q) ∈ U, 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 +2k} is a model of T (P ).\\nMoreover, every model of T (P ) is of the form U ∪{d(q, i): c(q) ∈ U, 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 +2k}, where\\nU ⊆ {c(q): q ∈ At} ∪ {c(q, i): q ∈ M, 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} ∪ {c−(q, i): q ∈ M, 2 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} is a\\nmodel of T0(P ).\\n\\nThe role of the clauses in the sets C0(q) is to decrease the effect of the atoms c−(q, i)\\nand c(q, i) on the size of models of T (P ). Consequently, given a model U of T0(P ), we\\ncan derive a bound on |{q ∈ At(P ): c(q) ∈ U}| from a bound on the size of the model of\\nT (P ) corresponding to U . Specifically, it is easy to see that T0(P ) has a model U with\\n|{q ∈ At(P ): c(q) ∈ U}| ≤ k if and only if T (P ) has a model of size at most (k +1)(k2 +2k).\\nThus, by Theorem 5.5, one can show that P has a stable model of size at most k if and only\\nif T (P ) has a model of size at most (k + 1)(k2 + 2k).

In the case of problems LSM and SSM , by fixing k\\nwe obtain the following two fixed-parameter problems (k is now no longer a part of input):\\n\\nLSM(k) Given a finite propositional logic program P , decide whether P has a stable model\\nof size at least |P | − k.\\n\\nSSM(k) Given a finite propositional logic program P , decide whether P has a stable model\\nof size at most k.\\n\\nThe problems LSM and SSM are NP-complete. It follows directly from the NP-\\ncompleteness of the problem of existence of stable models [13]. But fixing k makes a\\ndifference! Clearly, the fixed-parameter problems SSM(k) and LSM(k) can be solved in\\npolynomial time (unlike the problems SSM and LSM which, most likely, cannot). Indeed,\\nconsider a finite propositional logic program P with the set of atoms At(P ). Then, there are\\nO(|At(P )|k) subsets of At(P ) of cardinality at most k. For each such subset M , it can be\\nchecked in time linear in the size of P (the total number of all occurrences of atoms in P ; in\\nthe paper we will denote this number by size(P )) whether M is a stable model of P . Thus,\\none can decide whether P has a stable model of size at most k in time O(size(P )×|At(P )|k).\\n\\nSimilarly, there are only O(|P |k) subsets of P of size at least |P | − k. Each such subset\\nis a candidate for the set of generating rules of a stable model of size at least |P | − k (and\\nsmaller subsets, clearly, are not). Given such a subset R, one can check in time O(size(P ))\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\nwhether R generates a stable model for P . Thus, it follows that there is an algorithm that\\ndecides in time O(size(P )× |P |k) whether a logic program P has a stable model of size at\\nleast |P | − k.\\n\\nWhile both algorithms are polynomial in the size of the program, their asymptotic\\ncomplexity is expressed by the product of the size of a program and a polynomial of order k\\nin the number of atoms of the program or in the number of rules of the program. Even for\\nsmall values of k, say for k ≥ 4, the functions size(P ) × |At(P )|k and size(P ) × |P |k grow\\nvery fast with size(P ), |At(P )| and |P |, and render the corresponding algorithms infeasible.\\n\\nAn important question is whether algorithms for problems SSM(k) and LSM(k) exist\\nwhose order is significantly lower than k, preferably, a constant independent of k.

We outline\\nan algorithm to decide the problems SSM(k) that is asymptotically faster than the simple\\nalgorithm described above but the improvement is rather insignificant. Our algorithm\\nruns in time O(size(P ) × |At(P )|k−1), an improvement only by the factor of |At(P )|. The\\ndifficulty in finding a substantially better algorithm is not coincidental. We provide evidence\\nthat the problem SSM is fixed-parameter intractable. This result implies it is unlikely that\\nthere is an algorithm to decide the problems SSM(k) whose running time would be given\\nby a polynomial of order independent of k.\\n\\nThe study of fixed-parameter tractability of problems occuring in the area of nonmono-\\ntonic reasoning is a relatively new research topic.

To implement step 3, note\\nthat every stable model of the logic program Qk is determined by a subset of\\n\\n⋃\\n{b−(r): r ∈\\n\\nQk} [5]. By Lemma 3.2, there are no more than 2k+k2\\n\\nsuch candidate subsets to consider.\\nChecking for each of them whether it determines a stable model of Qk can be implemented\\nin time O(size(Qk)) = O(size(P )). Consequently, our algorithm runs in time O(2k+k2\\n\\n×\\nsize(P )) (with the constant hidden by the “big O” notation independent of k).\\n\\nTheorem 3.3 The problem LSM is fixed-parameter tractable. Moreover, for each fixed k\\nthere is a linear-time algorithm to decide whether a logic program P has a stable model of\\nsize at least |P | − k.\\n\\n4 Computing stable models of size at most k\\n\\nAs already mentioned, there is a straightforward algorithm to decide the problem SSM(k)\\nthat runs in time O(size(P ) × nk), where n = |At(P )|. This algorithm can be somewhat\\nimproved. In this section we will outline an algorithm for the problem SSM(k) that runs\\nin time O(size(P ) × nk−1). We will provide a detailed description in the cases k = 1 and\\nk = 2 and comment on how to extend this algorithm to the case of an arbitrary k.\\n\\nWe say that a logic program P is proper if it satisfies the following three conditions:\\n\\n(P1) for every rule r ∈ P , h(r) /∈ b+(r)\\n\\n(P2) for every rule r ∈ P , b+(r) ∩ b−(r) = ∅\\n\\n(P3)\\n⋃\\n{b−(r): r ∈ P} ⊆ H(P ).\\n\\nGiven a logic program P , its proper core is a logic program obtained from P by removing\\nfrom P every clause that violates conditions (P1) or (P2) and by enforcing (P3).

It also brings up interesting research questions.\\n\\nFirst, we showed that for every fixed k, existence of stable models of size at most k can be\\ncomputed in time O(nk−1×size(P )), where n is the number of atoms in the program. This\\nalgorithm offers a slight improvement over the straightforward “guess-and-check” algorithm.\\nHowever, the improvement comes at a cost of an increased space requirement. An interesting\\nand, it seems, a difficult problem is to significantly improve on this algorithm by lowering\\nthe exponent in the complexity estimate to αk, for some constant α < 1.\\n\\nWe also studied the complexity of the problem SSM and showed that it is fixed-\\nparameter intractable. Our results show that SSM is W [2]-hard. This result implies\\nthat the problem SSM is at least as hard as the problem to determine whether a CNF\\ntheory has a model of cardinality at most k, and strongly suggests that algorithms do not\\nexist that would decide problems SSM(k) and run in time O(nc), where c is a constant\\nindependent on k. We were unable to prove that the problem SSM belongs to class W [2].\\nWe could only show that it belongs to the class W [3]. Determining the exact location of the\\nproblem SSM in the W hierarchy is yet another open problems suggested by our paper.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe author thanks Victor Marek and Jennifer Seitzer for useful discussions and comments,\\nand to an anonymous referee for pointing out inaccuracies in proofs of some of the re-\\nsults.

If the product S × T has a reachable deadlock, then it has a\\n\\nreachable deadlock of the form (v∗, w∗) where v∗ is a deadlock of S and w∗ is a\\n\\ndeadlock of T .\\n\\nMoreover, this deadlock is reachable by first considering those motions trivial\\n\\nin T , and then considering those motions trivial in S.\\n\\nThe content of the proposition is that it suffices to check the subautomaton\\nof states of the form (v, w0) or (v∗, w) when searching for a reachable deadlock.\\nIn general, this subautomaton has a number of states bounded by #S +#T , as\\nopposed to the #S × #T states in the full product S × T .\\n\\nWe define a strong deadlock analysis of an automaton S: X → Y with initial\\nstate v to be a subautomaton T of S such that\\n\\n(i) T contains v\\n\\n(ii) If w is a deadlock state of S reachable from v, then w is in T .\\n\\nOne could also consider the notion of a weak deadlock analysis, where the second\\ncondition is replaced by the weaker condition\\n\\n(ii’) If a deadlock state of S is reachable from v, then T contains a deadlock\\nreachable from v.\\n\\nThen the content of the proposition 6 is that the subautomaton of S×T with\\nstates those states (v, w) such that v = v∗ or w = w0, and motions all motions\\nbetween these states, comprises a weak deadlock analysis of the product.

En términos generales, se refiere a la dificultad de construir y entrenar modelos de aprendizaje automático que sean tanto grandes (es decir, capaces de manejar y procesar una gran cantidad de datos) como estables (es decir, capaces de producir resultados consistentes y confiables a lo largo del tiempo).\n\nEste problema surge debido a varias razones. Primero, a medida que un modelo se vuelve más grande y complejo, también se vuelve más difícil de entrenar de manera efectiva. Esto se debe a que los modelos más grandes a menudo requieren más datos para entrenar y más tiempo y recursos computacionales para procesar esos datos.\n\nEn segundo lugar, a medida que un modelo se vuelve más grande, también puede volverse menos estable. Esto se debe a que los modelos más grandes pueden ser más susceptibles a problemas como el sobreajuste, donde el modelo se ajusta tan estrechamente a los datos de entrenamiento que se desempeña mal en los datos de prueba o en los datos nuevos.\n\nPor último, los modelos grandes y estables también pueden ser difíciles de mantener y actualizar. A medida que se recopilan y procesan más datos, el modelo puede necesitar ser reentrenado o ajustado para mantener su precisión y eficacia.\n\nEn resumen, el problema de los modelos grandes y estables es un desafío importante en el campo de la inteligencia artificial y el aprendizaje automático, y los investigadores están trabajando constantemente para desarrollar nuevas técnicas y enfoques para abordarlo."

        "\n",
        "## Embeddings and Vector Search\n",
        "\n",
        "From the Azure OpenAI documentation ([HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings?tabs=python)), An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. \n",

        "### Why Do We Need Vectors?\n",
        "\n",
        "Vectors are essential for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Semantic Richness**: They convert the semantic meaning of text into mathematical vectors, capturing nuances that simple keyword searches miss. This makes them incredibly powerful for understanding and processing language.\n",
        "- **Human-like Searching**: Searching using vector distances mimics the human approach to finding information based on context and meaning, rather than relying solely on exact word matches.\n",
        "- **Efficiency in Scale**: Vector representations allow for efficient handling and searching of large datasets. By reducing complex text to numerical vectors, algorithms can quickly sift through vast amounts of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Understanding LLM Tokens' Context Limitation\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT come with a token limit for each input, which poses a challenge when dealing with lengthy documents or extensive data sets. This limitation restricts the model's ability to understand and generate responses based on the full context of the information provided. It becomes crucial, therefore, to devise strategies that can effectively manage and circumvent this limitation to leverage the full power of LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this challenge, the solution incorporates several key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Segmenting Documents**: Breaking down large documents into smaller, manageable segments.\n",
        "2. **Vectorization of Chunks**: Converting these segments into vectors, making them compatible with vector-based search techniques.\n",
        "3. **Hybrid Search**: Employing both vector and text search methods to pinpoint the most relevant segments in relation to the query.\n",
        "4. **Optimal Context Provision**: Presenting the LLM with the most pertinent segments, ensuring a balance between detail and brevity to stay within token limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Our ultimate goal is to rely solely on vector indexes and hybrid searchs (vector + text). While it is possible to manually code parsers with OCR for various file types and develop a scheduler to synchronize data with the index, there is a more efficient alternative: **Azure AI Search has automated chunking strategies and vectorization**.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that **document segmentation and vectorization have already been completed in AI Azure Search**, as seen in the `ordered_content` dictionary.

We show that for every fixed integer k, there is a linear-time algorithm to decide\\nthe problem LSM (large stable models problem): does a logic program P have a stable\\nmodel of size at least |P | − k. In contrast, we show that the problem SSM (small stable\\nmodels problem) to decide whether a logic program P has a stable model of size at most\\nk is much harder. We present two algorithms for this problem but their running time is\\ngiven by polynomials of order depending on k. We show that the problem SSM is fixed-\\nparameter intractable by demonstrating that it is W [2]-hard. This result implies that it is\\nunlikely, an algorithm exists to compute stable models of size at most k that would run\\nin time O(nc), where c is a constant independent of k. We also provide an upper bound\\non the fixed-parameter complexity of the problem SSM by showing that it belongs to the\\nclass W [3].\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nThe stable model semantics by Gelfond and Lifschitz [10] is one of the two most widely\\nstudied semantics for normal logic programs, the other one being the well-founded seman-\\ntics by Van Gelder, Ross and Schlipf [17]. Among 2-valued semantics, the stable model\\nsemantics is commonly regarded as the one providing the correct meaning to the negation\\noperator in logic programming. It coincides with the least model semantics on the class\\nof Horn programs, and with the well-founded semantics and the perfect model semantics\\non the class of stratified programs [1]. In addition, the stable model semantics is closely\\nrelated to the notion of a default extension by Reiter [12, 4]. Logic programming with sta-\\nble model semantics has applications in knowledge representation, planning and reasoning\\nabout action. It was also recently proposed as a computational paradigm especially well\\nsuited for solving combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems [14, 15].\\n\\nThe problem with the stable model semantics is that, even in the propositional case,\\nreasoning with logic programs under the stable model semantics is computationally hard. It\\nis well-known that deciding whether a finite propositional logic program has a stable model\\nis NP-complete [13]. Consequently, it is not at all clear that logic programming with the\\nstable model semantics can serve as a practical computational tool.\\n\\n1This is a full version of an extended abstract presented at the International Conference on Logic Pro-\\ngramming, ICLP-99 and included in the proceedings published by MIT Press.\\n\\n1\\n\\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0002001v1\\n\\n\\nThis issue can be resolved by implementing systems computing stable models and by\\nexperimentally studying the performance of these systems. Several such projects are now\\nunder way. Niemelä and Simons [16] developed a system, smodels, for computing stable\\nmodels of finite function symbol-free logic programs and reported very promising perfor-\\nmance results. For some classes of programs, smodels decides the existence of a stable\\nmodel in a matter of seconds even if an input program consists of tens of thousands of\\nclauses. Encouraging results on using smodels to solve planning problems are reported\\nin [15]. Another well-advanced system is DeReS [6], designed to compute extensions of\\narbitrary propositional default theories but being especially effective for default theories\\nencoding propositional logic programs. Finally, systems capable of reasoning with disjunc-\\ntive logic programs were described in [9] and [2].\\n\\nHowever, faster implementations will ultimately depend on better understanding of the\\nalgorithmic aspects of reasoning with logic programs under the stable model semantics.

As mentioned earlier, it follows that M ′ =\\n{xj1(1), . . . , xjk\\n\\n(k)} ∪M , where M is a nonempty subset of At(P ) such that |M | ≤ k and\\nxj1 , . . . , xjk\\n\\nis an enumeration of all elements of M .\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider a clause c = a1 ∨ . . . ∨ as ∨ ¬b1 ∨ . . . ∨ ¬bt from C.

Hence, M is a model of C. ✷\\n\\nNow the reducibility of the problem WS(k) to the problem SSM(2k) is evident. Given\\na collection of clauses C, to check whether it has a model of size at most k, we first check\\nwhether the empty set of atoms is a model of C. If so, we return the answer YES and\\nterminate the algorithm. Otherwise, we construct the program PC and check whether it\\nhas a stable model of size at most 2k. Consequently, we obtain the following result.\\n\\nTheorem 5.8 The problem SSM is W[2]-hard.\\n\\n6 Open problems and conclusions\\n\\nThe paper established several results pertaining to the problem of computing small and\\nlarge stable models. It also brings up interesting research questions.\\n\\nFirst, we showed that for every fixed k, existence of stable models of size at most k can be\\ncomputed in time O(nk−1×size(P )), where n is the number of atoms in the program. This\\nalgorithm offers a slight improvement over the straightforward “guess-and-check” algorithm.\\nHowever, the improvement comes at a cost of an increased space requirement. An interesting\\nand, it seems, a difficult problem is to significantly improve on this algorithm by lowering\\nthe exponent in the complexity estimate to αk, for some constant α < 1.\\n\\nWe also studied the complexity of the problem SSM and showed that it is fixed-\\nparameter intractable. Our results show that SSM is W [2]-hard. This result implies\\nthat the problem SSM is at least as hard as the problem to determine whether a CNF\\ntheory has a model of cardinality at most k, and strongly suggests that algorithms do not\\nexist that would decide problems SSM(k) and run in time O(nc), where c is a constant\\nindependent on k. We were unable to prove that the problem SSM belongs to class W [2].\\nWe could only show that it belongs to the class W [3]. Determining the exact location of the\\nproblem SSM in the W hierarchy is yet another open problems suggested by our paper.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe author thanks Victor Marek and Jennifer Seitzer for useful discussions and comments,\\nand to an anonymous referee for pointing out inaccuracies in proofs of some of the re-\\nsults.

The program\\nP has a stable model of size at most k if and only if the theory T0(P ) has a model U such\\nthat |{q ∈ At(P ): c(q) ∈ U}| ≤ k}.\\n\\nWe will now modify the theory T0(P ) to construct a theory T (P ) that demonstrates\\nthat the problem SSM(k) can be reduced to the problem WS(3). First, for each atom\\nq ∈ At(P ), introduce k2 + 2k new atoms d(q, i), 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 + 2k, and define\\n\\nC0(q) = {¬c(q) ∨ d(q, i): 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 + 2k} ∪ {c(q) ∨ ¬d(q, i): 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 + 2k}.\\n\\nNext, define\\n\\nC1(q, i) = {¬c−(q, i) ∨ c(q, 1) ∨ . . . ∨ c(q, i− 1)} ∪ {¬c(q, j) ∨ c−(q, i): 1 ≤ j ≤ i− 1},\\n\\nC2(q) = {¬c(q) ∨ c(q, 1) ∨ . . . ∨ c(q, k + 1)} ∪ {¬c(q, j) ∨ c(q): 1 ≤ j ≤ k + 1},\\n\\nand\\n\\nC4(q, i) = {¬c(q, i) ∨ F3(r1, i) ∨ . . . ∨ F3(rt, i)} ∪ {¬F3(rj , i) ∨ c(q, i): 1 ≤ j ≤ m},\\n\\nwhere {r1, . . . , rt} is the set of all rules in P with q in the head.\\nFinally, define\\n\\nT (P ) = {C0(q): q ∈ At(P )} ∪ {C1(q, i): q ∈ At(P ), 2 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} ∪\\n\\n{C2(q): q ∈ At(P )} ∪ {C4(q, i): q ∈ At(P ), 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1}\\n\\nIt is easy to see that the set of clauses C1(q, i) is equivalent to the formula F1(q, i), the set\\nof clauses C2(q) is equivalent to the formula F2(q), and the set C4(q, i) of disjunctions of\\nconjunctions of literals is equivalent to the formula F4(q, i). Thus, the union of the last three\\nsets of clauses in the definition of T (P ) is logically equivalent to the theory T0(P ). It follows\\nthat U ⊆ {c(q): q ∈ At} ∪ {c(q, i): q ∈M, 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} ∪ {c−(q, i): q ∈M, 2 ≤ i ≤ k + 1}\\nis a model of T0(P ) if and only if U ∪{d(q, i): c(q) ∈ U, 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 +2k} is a model of T (P ).\\nMoreover, every model of T (P ) is of the form U ∪{d(q, i): c(q) ∈ U, 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 +2k}, where\\nU ⊆ {c(q): q ∈ At} ∪ {c(q, i): q ∈ M, 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} ∪ {c−(q, i): q ∈ M, 2 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} is a\\nmodel of T0(P ).\\n\\nThe role of the clauses in the sets C0(q) is to decrease the effect of the atoms c−(q, i)\\nand c(q, i) on the size of models of T (P ). Consequently, given a model U of T0(P ), we\\ncan derive a bound on |{q ∈ At(P ): c(q) ∈ U}| from a bound on the size of the model of\\nT (P ) corresponding to U . Specifically, it is easy to see that T0(P ) has a model U with\\n|{q ∈ At(P ): c(q) ∈ U}| ≤ k if and only if T (P ) has a model of size at most (k +1)(k2 +2k).\\nThus, by Theorem 5.5, one can show that P has a stable model of size at most k if and only\\nif T (P ) has a model of size at most (k + 1)(k2 + 2k). In other words, the problem SSM\\ncan be reduced to the problem WS(3).\\n\\nTheorem 5.6 The problem SSM(k) ∈W [3].\\n\\nNext, we will show that the problem WS(2) can be reduced to the problem SSM .

It follows directly from the NP-\\ncompleteness of the problem of existence of stable models [13]. But fixing k makes a\\ndifference! Clearly, the fixed-parameter problems SSM(k) and LSM(k) can be solved in\\npolynomial time (unlike the problems SSM and LSM which, most likely, cannot). Indeed,\\nconsider a finite propositional logic program P with the set of atoms At(P ). Then, there are\\nO(|At(P )|k) subsets of At(P ) of cardinality at most k. For each such subset M , it can be\\nchecked in time linear in the size of P (the total number of all occurrences of atoms in P ; in\\nthe paper we will denote this number by size(P )) whether M is a stable model of P . Thus,\\none can decide whether P has a stable model of size at most k in time O(size(P )×|At(P )|k).\\n\\nSimilarly, there are only O(|P |k) subsets of P of size at least |P | − k. Each such subset\\nis a candidate for the set of generating rules of a stable model of size at least |P | − k (and\\nsmaller subsets, clearly, are not).

Even for\\nsmall values of k, say for k ≥ 4, the functions size(P ) × |At(P )|k and size(P ) × |P |k grow\\nvery fast with size(P ), |At(P )| and |P |, and render the corresponding algorithms infeasible.\\n\\nAn important question is whether algorithms for problems SSM(k) and LSM(k) exist\\nwhose order is significantly lower than k, preferably, a constant independent of k.

We outline\\nan algorithm to decide the problems SSM(k) that is asymptotically faster than the simple\\nalgorithm described above but the improvement is rather insignificant. Our algorithm\\nruns in time O(size(P ) × |At(P )|k−1), an improvement only by the factor of |At(P )|. The\\ndifficulty in finding a substantially better algorithm is not coincidental. We provide evidence\\nthat the problem SSM is fixed-parameter intractable.

To compute it, we start by initializing all its entries to\\n0. The initialization takes O(n2) time. Next, for each rule r we compute the complement of\\nits body, say c−(r) = At(P )\\\\b−(r). This task takes O(n) steps for each rule, for the total of\\nO(|P |×n). Finally, for each rule r we check whether h(r) ∈ c−(r) (it can be tested in O(n)\\nsteps) and, if so, for each b ∈ c−(r) we increment G0(h(r), b) by 1. The total time needed\\nto accomplish this third phase of the computation is O(|P | × n). Since n = O(size(P ))\\nand|P | = O(size(P )), G0 can be computed in time O(n× size(P )).

To this end,\\n\\nwe first compute the arrays F1, and F2, where\\n\\nF1(a) = the number of rules r in P such that a /∈ b−(r)\\nF2(a, b) = the number of rules r in P such that a ∈ b−(r) and b ∈ b−(r).\\n\\nThe array F1 can clearly be computed in time O(n × size(P )) (initialize F1 to 0; then,\\nfor each rule r and for each a in the complement c−(r) of b−(r) increment F1(a) by 1).\\nTo compute the array F2, we first initialize it to 0. Then, for each rule r and for each\\na, b ∈ b−(r), a 6= b, we increment F2(a, b) by 1. Thus, F2 can be computed in time\\nO(\\n\\n∑\\nr∈P |b\\n\\n−(r)|2) = O(n ×\\n∑\\n\\nr∈P |b\\n−(r)|) = O(n × size(P )).

Thus, G′\\n4\\n\\nand, consequently, G4 can be computed in time O(n× size(P )), as claimed.\\nLemmas 4.2 and 4.4 imply the following algorithm to decide the problem SSM(2):\\n\\n1.

Otherwise, use the algorithm implied by Lemma 4.4 to decide whether P has stable\\nmodels of size 2 (that is, compute tables Gi and check the condition of Lemma 4.4 for\\neach set of two atoms). If so, output YES and otherwise output NO.\\n\\nIt follows from our discussion on computing the arrays Gi, i = 0, . . . , 4, that our algo-\\nrithm can be implemented to run in time O(n× size(P )), where n is the number of atoms\\noccurring in P . However, the algorithm requires that several n× n arrays be maintained.\\n\\nThe algorithms presented in this section can be generalized to the case of an arbitrary\\nk. We will only present a very general outline here. The details are rather complex and are\\nomitted. First, observe that by Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2, it is enough to describe the algorithm\\nfor proper logic programs with at most k positive atoms in the body. Hence, consider\\nsuch a program P . As in the case of k = 2, we first compute programs P0 = P (0), and\\nPi = P (i) \\\\ P (i − 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Next, we establish a lemma, corresponding to Lemmas\\n4.3 and 4.4 that we used in the cases k = 1 and k = 2, characterizing stable models\\nof size at most k in terms of the numbers of rules in the programs Pi satisfying certain\\nproperties. These numbers can be arranged in no more than f(k) tables (for some function\\nf) of dimensions no more than k. One can show that these tables can be computed in time\\nO(size(P ) × nk−1) and that the whole algorithm can also be implemented to run in time\\nO(size(P ) × nk−1).\\n\\n5 Complexity of the problem SSM\\n\\nThe algorithm outlined in the previous section is not quite satisfactory.

Our encoding,\\nwhile different in key details, uses some ideas from that paper.\\n\\nLet us consider an integer k and a logic program P . For each atom q in P let us introduce\\nnew atoms c(q), c(q, i), 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1, and c−(q, i), 2 ≤ i ≤ k + 1.

Similarly, atom c(q, i) represents the fact that in the\\nsame process atom q is computed exactly in the iteration i of the van Emden-Kowalski\\noperator. Finally, atom c−(q, i), expresses the fact that q is computed before the iteration\\ni of the van Emden-Kowalski operator.

By P (k) we will denote the program obtained from P by\\nremoving from it each clause with more than k atoms appearing positively in its body. In\\nour discussion below we will use the following result.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\nLemma 4.2 Let P be a proper logic program and let M be a set of atoms such that |M | ≤ k.\\nThen M is a stable model of P if and only if M is a stable model of P (k).\\n\\nProof: Assume that M is a stable model of P (k). Then M = LM(P (k)M ). Since\\nP (k) ⊆ P , M ⊆ LM(PM ). Assume that LM(PM ) \\\\ M 6= ∅. Then, there is a rule\\nq ← a1, . . . , ap,not(b1), . . . ,not(bm) in P such that ai ∈M , 1 ≤ i ≤ p, bi /∈M , 1 ≤ i ≤ m,\\nand q /∈ M . Since |M | ≤ k, we have that p ≤ k and, consequently, this rule belongs to\\nP (k). Thus, q ∈ LM(P (k)M ) = M , a contradiction. It follows that LP (PM ) ⊆M . Hence,\\nLP (PM ) = M and M is a stable model of P .\\n\\nLet us now assume that M is a stable model of P . Then M = LM(PM ) =\\n⋃\\n\\ni=0 T i\\nPM\\n\\n(∅)\\n(T with a subscript pointing to a program stands for the van Emden-Kowalski operator).\\nSince |M | ≤ k, one can prove by induction on i that T i\\n\\nPM\\n(∅) ⊆ T i\\n\\nP (k)M\\n(∅). Thus, M ⊆\\n\\nLM(P (k)M . On the other hand, since P (k) ⊆ P , we have LM(P (k)M ) ⊆ M . Thus,\\nM = LM(P (k)M ) and M is a stable model for P (k). ✷\\n\\nWe will now present an algorithm to decide the problem SSM(1). Define P0 = P (0)\\nand P1 = P (1) \\\\ P (0). In other words, Pi, i = 0, 1, consists of those rules in P that have\\nexactly i different atoms occurring positively in the body. Next, for each atom a define:\\n\\nH0(a) = the number of rules r in P0 with h(r) = a and a /∈ b−(r)\\nH1(a) = the number of rules r in P1 with a ∈ b+(r) (since r ∈ P1, there are no\\nother positive atoms in the body of r)\\nH2(a) = the number of rules r in P0 with h(r) 6= a and a /∈ b−(r).\\n\\nWe have the following lemma.\\n\\nLemma 4.3 Let P be a proper logic program. The set {a} is a stable model of P (1) if and\\nonly if H0(a) ≥ 1 and H1(a) = H2(a) = 0.\\n\\nProof: Assume that H0(a) ≥ 1 and H1(a) = H2(a) = 0. Since H0(a) ≥ 1, there is a rule\\na← not(b1), . . . ,not(bm) in P (1) such that a 6= bi, 1 ≤ i ≤ m. It follows that the rule a←\\nis in the reduct P (1){a}. Consequently, a ∈ LM(P (1){a}). Next, let us note that {a} is a\\nmodel of P (1){a}. Indeed, if a rule r = (q ← a1, . . . , ap) is in P (1){a}, it follows that p ≤ 1.\\nIf p = 0, then q = a (as H2(a) = 0). If p = 1, a1 6= a (as H1(a) = 0). In each case, {a}\\nsatisfies r. Thus, {a} = LM(P (1){a} and, consequently, {a} is a stable model of P (1). The\\nargument for the “only if” part of the statement is similar and is left to the reader. ✷\\n\\nClearly, the tables H0, H1 and H2 can be computed in time O(size(P )). Since it takes\\nlinear time to decide whether the empty set is a stable model of a program, Lemmas 4.2\\nand 4.3 imply a linear-time algorithm to decide whether a logic program P has a stable\\nmodel of size at most 1.\\n\\nWe will next describe an algorithm to decide whether a logic program has a stable model\\nof size at most 2. Consider a proper logic program P . As before, define P0 = P (0) and\\nP1 = P (1) \\\\ P (0). In addition, define P2 = P (2) \\\\ P (1).\\n\\nFor every two different atoms a and b in P define:\\n\\nG0(a, b) = the number of rules r in P0 with h(r) = a, a /∈ b−(r) and b /∈ b−(r)\\nG1(a, b) = the number of rules r in P1 such that h(r) = b, b+(r) = {a}, a /∈ b−(r)\\nand b /∈ b−(r)\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\nG2(a, b) = the number of rules r in P2 with b+(r) = {a, b}\\nG3(a, b) = the number of rules r in P1 with b+(r) = {a}, h(r) 6= b and b /∈ b−(r)\\nG4(a, b) = the number of rules r in P0 with h(r) /∈ {a, b}, a /∈ b−(r) and\\nb /∈ b−(r).\\n\\nWe have the following lemma. The proof is similar to that of Lemma 4.3 and is omitted.\\n\\nLemma 4.4 Let P be a proper logic program. Then, the set {a, b} is a stable model for\\nP if and only if G2(a, b) = G3(a, b) = G4(a, b) = 0 and at least one of the following three\\nconditions holds:\\n\\n1. G0(a, b) ≥ 1 and G0(b, a) ≥ 1\\n\\n2. G0(a, b) ≥ 1 and G1(a, b) ≥ 1\\n\\n3. G0(b, a) ≥ 1 and G1(b, a) ≥ 1.\\n\\nObserve that each of the arrays Gi, 0 ≤ i ≤ 4, can be computed in time O(n× size(P )).\\nIndeed, let us consider the array G0. To compute it, we start by initializing all its entries to\\n0. The initialization takes O(n2) time.
