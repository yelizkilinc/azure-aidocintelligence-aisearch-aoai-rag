In general, investments with original maturities of greater'\n...Line 'than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments.

Debt investments are'\n...Line 'impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market'\n...Line 'information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers'\n...Line 'available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its'\n...Line 'fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent'\n...Line 'to which the fair value is less than cost. We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will'\n...Line 'be required to sell the security before recovery. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and'\n...Line 'business outlook, for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash'\n...Line 'flow factors.
